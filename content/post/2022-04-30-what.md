As a person who has never written a ray tracer before, I think [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) is a great book if you want to get it running without a big wall of text about optics theory.

## Opinion

RTiOW is a great, relatively quick introduction into the ray tracing concepts with a working example. However, I definitely think it's not the book to choose if you're looking for a formal/academic/theoretical textbook. It's simple and gets straight to coding, explaining theory only when it's needed. There are two sequels to RTiOW which I did not check. They're probably a good next step if one wants to continue. \
I am very happy with the final result and so I rate it positively. I didn't expect that you could get images of such quality so "easily".

## Example results

The first one is my favorite.

## Takeaways

- Ray tracing is very expensive computationally – of course I knew this before, but hearing fans on full speed and checking CPU usage of a high-end Macbook Pro really makes you acknowledge it. Then, you wait for 15 minutes and you really realize it. Fortunately, I've added multithreading (which is not shown in the book) and it shortened the time drastically. Still, a few minutes are needed for a picture like the ones presented above. I wonder how much faster would the exact same program be if it was implemented for a GPU in something like CUDA.
- In code that is meant to perform physics simulations, it's easy to create numerous magic numbers which are difficult to name and categorise. They just come from the laws of physics/maths.
- There is so much more out there – the book uses (very understandably) some simplifications. In the real world there are more shapes than a sphere. In fact, there are arbitrary models. More materials. There are textures. There are multiple light sources. I don't want to imagine how physics-intensive it is.
